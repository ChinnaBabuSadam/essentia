CCT won't alloow you to pass the authorization header.  So, you can't fetch the lbdoc for your cloned elements.
So, this helps you to fetch your local lbdoc of your cloned elements..... (Works for system elements also)
Note: Make sure you have installed NodeJS already

1. Unzip the package, and open /hitLbdocApi/api/controllers/util/helper.js
   => In helper.js, there is a variable 'LOCAL_USER_ORG'.  So, change it to your SOBA's localhost authorization header
   => If your SOBA port is other than '8080', then you have to change this on line number 28 of helper.js to your SOBA's port.  i.e.  siteAddress = 'http://localhost:{Wahtever your Local SOBA port}';

2. Open the directory with your terminal and make sure you are at .../hitLbdocApi
 
3. Run npm install unirest
       npm install express --save

4. And run your node server with 
       npm run start

5. Note down the port, on which your node server running.  Probably, It would be on '3000'

6. Tunnel your node-server with ngrok, on the above PORT.

7. Here we have an API /hitLbdoc/{element}
   So, now you can run it with ngrok as follows  (Make sure your SOBA is running)

   Another Note:  Don't use 'http' for CCT always use 'https'
